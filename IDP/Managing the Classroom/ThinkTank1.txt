Case 1 and Case 2



- Meet all students involved together.  If it was the first time for the students, I would confront them all at the same time, and show them the evidence.  Then I would explain that 50% of the mark is up for grabs.  If they want to tell which one of them actually did the work, that person would receive 50% of the grade acheived on assignment.  The rest would get zero.
I would fill out a PASS form for each to be filed with department head

- If not the first time, I would refer them to the department head
