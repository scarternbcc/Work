It's best to have an opening
To put our mind in gear
It's something I will implement
In this coming school year

If the class is early
And the students not awake
Have some fun and give "ice" a break

People learn differently
They are not all like me
If I start to be more open to that
I may have just found they key

Dont play a roll 
or wear a mask
Be authentic 
and you'll win the class

Over the past 2 weeks
A many ideas did we collect
An important one in my mind
Was to provide time to reflect
