# Thibodeau, Riley

#### January 5, 2022

* Met via Teams

* Explained that he did not get credit for Intro to Programming, Dev Tools and that he would have to take them Fall 2022 and it would put off his graduation by 1 year

* He was waiting to write Math Sup and a Database Design sup.  I told him I would wait to see the results of that, and then come up with a tentative plan for Spring 2022 and Fall 2022
