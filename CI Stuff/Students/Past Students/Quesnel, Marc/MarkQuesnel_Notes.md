* Met via Teams

* Explained that he did not get credit for Intro to Programming.

* He asked if he should take it online, and I said he could, but I suggested that he take it next fall 2022 in person so that it is fresh in his head for OOP in winter term.

* He was waiting to write Math Sup.  I told him I would wait to see the results of that, and then come up with a tentative plan for Spring 2022 and Fall 2022
