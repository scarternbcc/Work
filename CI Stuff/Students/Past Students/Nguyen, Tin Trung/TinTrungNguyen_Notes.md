* Met via Teams

* Explained that he did not get credit for Database Design.  Told him that he may be able to get credit for it at another institution, and I would get back to him on how he could go about looking into that.

* If he didn't get credit at another institution, we would have to squeeze it into Fall 2022, but this could only happen if there was a slot in the schedule for the course offering that did not conflict with his Senior course schedule
